Effortlessly schedule multiple sales for your WooCommerce products, ensuring timely discounts and seamless promotions.

== Description ==

**Multiple Sale Scheduler**
Effortlessly schedule and manage multiple sales for your WooCommerce productsâ€”both single and grouped. Plan sales periods in advance to boost customer engagement and drive conversions with well-timed promotions.

Default WooCommerce sale functionality is in priority. If product is already on sale then
Multiple sale scheduler will not override it.

== Note ==
The WooCommerce default sale scheduler may not be overridden in the following scenarios:
1. When only the sale price is set, but no start or end dates are defined in the default WooCommerce fields.
2. When the sale price, along with both the start and end dates, is set in the default WooCommerce fields.
3. When the sale price is set, but only one of the start or end dates is defined in the default WooCommerce fields.

== Developer Note ==

Ensure the use of msswc_get_product_ids_on_sale() instead of wc_get_product_ids_on_sale().

 - msswc_get_product_ids_on_sale() will return all product IDs on sale, including those scheduled using the Multiple Sale Scheduler plugin.

 - In contrast, wc_get_product_ids_on_sale() only retrieves product IDs set on sale via the default WooCommerce sale functionality.
